Type checking: ⚠️ (see TypeScript errors)
ESLint: ✅
Prettier: ✅
CSS Linting: ✅
Tests: ✅
Cross-browser compatibility: ⚠️ (see warnings)

==================================
CROSS-BROWSER COMPATIBILITY ISSUES
==================================
- ⚠️ Limited browser coverage in BrowserStack configuration
  Current browsers: os:Windows10
  Recommendation: Add at least Chrome, Firefox, and Safari for comprehensive testing
- ⚠️ Limited OS coverage in BrowserStack configuration
  Recommendation: Test on both Windows and macOS

CSS Compatibility Issues:
- ⚠️ Flexbox without vendor prefixes
  Recommendation: Use autoprefixer to add necessary vendor prefixes for older browsers

Browser Detection Issues:

Responsive Design Issues:
- ⚠️ Missing viewport meta tag in index.html
  Recommendation: Add <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
- ⚠️ Limited media queries (1 found)
  Recommendation: Implement responsive breakpoints for different device sizes
- ⚠️ No tablet breakpoint (768px) found
  Recommendation: Add breakpoints for common device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ⚠️ No touch event handlers found
  Recommendation: Add touch event handlers for mobile devices

Cross-Browser Test Results:
- ⚠️ Chrome tests failed or couldn't run
- ⚠️ Firefox tests failed or couldn't run
- ⚠️ Edge tests failed or couldn't run

==================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
==================================
1. Ensure proper browser testing coverage with at least Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
2. Use feature detection instead of browser detection
3. Ensure responsive design with proper breakpoints and touch event handling
4. Use appropriate polyfills or babel plugins for modern JavaScript features
5. Run tests across multiple browsers and devices regularly
