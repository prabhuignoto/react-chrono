## Upload Tips for Medium

1. **Drag and drop** images directly into the Medium editor at the marked locations
2. **Add captions** to each image using the suggested text above
3. **Click image** and use the alignment tools to center them
4. **Resize** if needed using Medium's built-in image sizing (usually "large" works best)
5. Images will **auto-optimize** when you upload them to Medium

## Alternative: Create a Custom Header Graphic

Consider creating a custom header graphic that combines:
- The React-Chrono logo
- "Version 3.0" badge
- Key selling points (e.g., "Zero Breaking Changes • 10x Features • Built for Modern React")
- Visual timeline element
- Color gradient matching the brand

Tools you can use:
- **Canva** - Easy drag-and-drop design
- **Figma** - Professional design tool
- **Photopea** - Free Photoshop alternative

Recommended size: **1400 x 700 pixels** (Medium's optimal header size)

## Image Placement Strategy

The article uses a **visual rhythm** approach:

- **Text section** → **Image** → **Text section** → **Image**
- This keeps readers engaged and breaks up long content blocks
- Each image reinforces the point made in the surrounding text
- Images appear approximately every 3-5 paragraphs
