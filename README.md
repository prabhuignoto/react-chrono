pnpm add react-chrono
```

**Requirements**: React 18.2+ | TypeScript 4.0+ (optional) | Modern browsers

## üéØ Basic Usage

### Minimal Setup - Your First Timeline

Get started with just two lines of code:

```jsx
import { Chrono } from 'react-chrono';

const items = [
  { title: 'May 1940', cardTitle: 'Dunkirk', cardDetailedText: 'Allied evacuation from France' },

**Horizontal Timeline with Custom Theme**
```jsx
<Chrono
  items={items}
  mode="horizontal"
  theme={{ primary: '#0070f3', cardBgColor: '#f5f5f5' }}
/>
```

**Vertical Timeline with Media**
```jsx
const items = [
  {
    title: 'January 2024',

      type: 'fade'
    }
  }}
/>
```

### Advanced Configuration with Grouped API ‚ú®

The new grouped API organizes configuration into logical sections for better discoverability and maintainability:

  content={{ allowHTML: true, readMore: true }}
/>
```

> **üöÄ Migration Made Easy**: All existing v2.x props work alongside the new grouped API for seamless upgrades.

## üé≠ Timeline Modes

React Chrono offers four thoughtfully designed layout modes, each optimized for specific content types and user experiences:

### üîÑ **Horizontal Mode - Classic Storytelling**
The traditional timeline experience where users navigate chronologically from left to right. Perfect for historical narratives, project phases, or any sequential story where the journey matters as much as the destinations. Users can smoothly scroll through time or use navigation controls for precise movement.

### üì± **Vertical Mode - Mobile-First Design** 
A space-efficient, scroll-friendly layout that works beautifully on all devices. Content flows naturally from top to bottom, making it ideal for social media feeds, news timelines, or any scenario where users expect familiar scrolling behavior. Automatically adapts to narrow screens without sacrificing readability.

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Alternating Mode - Visual Balance**
The most visually striking option, where timeline cards gracefully alternate between left and right sides of a central axis. This symmetric design creates natural visual rhythm, prevents monotony, and maximizes screen real estate utilization. Excellent for portfolios, company milestones, or any content that benefits from balanced presentation.

### üñ•Ô∏è **Horizontal All - Dashboard Overview**
Displays all timeline items simultaneously in a comprehensive dashboard view. Users can see the entire timeline at once, making it perfect for project overviews, comparative analysis, or situations where the complete picture is more important than individual item focus.

## üé¨ Showcase: What React Chrono Can Do

### üì∫ Rich Media Integration That Just Works

React Chrono transforms media-heavy timelines into smooth, engaging experiences. Images load intelligently using intersection observers - only when they're about to enter the viewport, ensuring fast initial page loads even with dozens of high-resolution photos. Videos can auto-play when their timeline item becomes active, creating cinematic storytelling experiences where each moment unfolds naturally.

The component handles all media complexities automatically: responsive image sizing, video buffering states, accessibility attributes, and performance optimization. Whether you're showcasing a product development journey with screenshots, a historical timeline with archival footage, or a personal story with family photos, React Chrono ensures every visual element enhances rather than hinders the user experience.

### üéÆ Interactive Features That Engage Users

**Immersive Slideshow Experience**: Transform your timeline into an auto-playing presentation with customizable durations, transition effects, and progress indicators. Perfect for kiosks, presentations, or guided storytelling where you want to control the narrative pace.

**Universal Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility goes beyond compliance - it creates power-user experiences. Arrow keys for navigation, Home/End for quick jumps, Enter for selections, and Escape for mode exits. Every interaction includes smooth animations that respect user motion preferences.

**Intelligent Real-time Search**: Built-in search functionality instantly highlights matching content across titles, descriptions, and metadata. Users can quickly find specific events in long timelines without losing context of the overall narrative structure.

### üé® Theming That Matches Your Brand

React Chrono's theming system adapts to any visual identity. Dark mode isn't just an afterthought - it's a first-class feature with dedicated properties for shadows, glows, hover states, and interaction feedback. Create high-contrast themes for accessibility, subtle branded experiences for corporate sites, or bold artistic expressions for creative portfolios.

Google Fonts integration makes typography customization effortless. Define font families, weights, and sizes for different content types, and React Chrono handles the loading optimization and fallback strategies automatically. Your timeline typography becomes an extension of your brand voice.

### üåç Global Reach with Complete Internationalization

**Comprehensive Multi-Language Support**: React Chrono speaks your users' language with complete internationalization coverage. Every piece of user-facing text - from navigation buttons to search placeholders, error messages to accessibility labels - can be customized for any language or locale.

**Smart Text Resolution**: The i18n system uses intelligent fallback strategies. Configure only the texts you need to change, and React Chrono automatically fills in the gaps with sensible defaults. Template strings support variable interpolation, so "Page {current} of {total}" becomes "P√°gina 3 de 10" seamlessly.

**Developer-Friendly Implementation**: No complex setup required. Simply pass your text configurations through the `i18n` prop, and React Chrono handles the rest. The type-safe interface guides you through available text categories, while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing applications.

```jsx
<Chrono
  items={items}
  i18n={{
    texts: {
      navigation: {
        first: 'Premier √©l√©ment',
        next: 'Suivant',
        previous: 'Pr√©c√©dent'
      },
      search: {
        placeholder: 'Rechercher dans la chronologie',
        noResults: 'Aucun r√©sultat trouv√©'
      }
    }
  }}
/>
```

### üèóÔ∏è Advanced Architecture for Complex Content

**Nested Timeline Hierarchies**: Create sophisticated multi-level narratives where major events contain their own detailed sub-timelines. Perfect for historical periods with multiple concurrent storylines, project phases with individual task breakdowns, or biographical timelines with detailed life chapters.

**Custom Component Integration**: Beyond text and media, embed fully interactive React components within timeline cards. Display data visualizations, interactive maps, embedded widgets, or custom UI elements that turn static timeline items into dynamic experiences.

### üì± Responsive Intelligence Across All Devices

React Chrono doesn't just shrink to fit smaller screens - it fundamentally adapts its interaction model. Desktop users get precision hover states and multi-column layouts. Tablet users experience optimized touch targets and gesture-friendly navigation. Mobile users receive simplified interfaces that prioritize content over chrome, with smart font sizing and spacing adjustments that maintain readability without compromising information density.
